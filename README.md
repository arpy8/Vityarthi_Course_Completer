# Vityarthi Course Completer
Web automation program designed to complete your [Vityarthi Python Course](https://vityarthi.com/classes?sort=newest)! This program is designed to help save you time and effort by automating the repetitive tasks of marking the videos as done.

# Installation
- Clone the repo using:  
```
  git clone https://github.com/arpy8/vityarthi-course-completer
```

- Do these before running "main.py"
  - Install latest ChromeDriver from the official website. ([already included](https://github.com/arpy8/vityarthi-course-completer/blob/main/assets/chromedriver.exe))
  - Edit "user_info.txt" and enter your details accordingly. 
  - Go to [settings](https://vityarthi.com/panel/setting) in vityarthi and enter your email (college email) and password.

The program will automatically go through each video and mark it as done for every module that is specified, allowing you to focus on other important things while the program does the work. 

### Few things I'd like to share about this project:
- This project is still under developmental phase.
- There's a bug which doesn't allow this app to complete module 1, avoid selecting it. I'll try to resolve it asap.
- Please keep in mind my program's basic work is to just trigger the "I passed this lesson" button for every video, so in case there is any video which is already marked as done, the bot will click it too.
- Avoid interacting with the machine while the programming is running, since doing that would result in an error and cause the program to crash.
